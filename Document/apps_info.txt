**Customer App:**

**Purpose:**

- Manage customer data beyond basic authentication information.
- Store details like name, address, phone number, and preferences.
- Link customers to their accounts in the Accounts app (using a ManyToManyField relationship).
- Potentially link to orders in an Orders app (using a ForeignKey relationship).

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns for user authentication (Authentication app) and customer-specific data (Customer app).
- Flexibility to add customer-specific features like loyalty programs or purchase history tracking in the future (without modifying the User model).
- Improved data organization and maintainability.

**Services App:**

**Purpose:**

- Define and manage the services you offer to customers (e.g., product descriptions, pricing).
- Manage service categories or types.
- Potentially link with Orders app to track service inclusions within orders.

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns for customer data (Customer app) and services offered (Services app).
- Easier management of service details and updates.
- Reusable service information for orders and other functionalities.

**Employee App:**

**Purpose:**

- Manage employee data like names, roles, and permissions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within your application.
- Potentially link with Authentication app for employee login and authorization.

**Benefits:**

- Dedicated space to manage employee information and access levels.

- Scalability as your team grows.

**Notification App:**

**Purpose:**

- Provide a central system for sending notifications (emails, SMS) to customers and employees.

**In summary:**
